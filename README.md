# Value-At-Risk-calculations
Python Class that calculates automatically the VaR.
The user just needs to insert the equity data and the weights in the object.
Then, the user needs to generate the portfolio returns by only using the "port_returns()" function, it automatically creates the portfolio returns with the weights given.
After that, specify the confidence level and in the case of the historical simulation VaR and Montecarlo VaR, specify the confidence level plus the number of simulations.
